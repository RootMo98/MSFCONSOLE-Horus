# MSFCONSOLE-Horus
Horus Project: Modular Recon and Vulnerability Scanning Suite
Horus is a modular collection of reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploit suggestion scripts designed for penetration testers and security enthusiasts. It focuses on breaking down the pentesting workflow into specific phases, providing flexibility and automation for various tasks such as service enumeration, vulnerability detection, and exploitation.

Key Features:
Reconnaissance: Comprehensive port and service scanning using Nmap and Metasploit to identify open ports, services, and operating systems.
Service-Specific Vulnerability Scans: Modular scripts for scanning SMB, HTTP, FTP, SSH, WinRM, and more for known vulnerabilities.
Exploit Suggestions: Dynamic generation of Metasploit exploits and integration with Searchsploit to map vulnerabilities to potential exploits.
Web Application Inspection: Automation for web service inspection, including browser prompts and Eyewitness for web screenshots.
Brute-Force Automation: Scripts to automate brute-forcing of credentials for services like SSH, FTP, WinRM, and web login pages.
Custom Reporting: Generate detailed terminal-based reports that summarize scan results, vulnerabilities, and exploitation possibilities.
